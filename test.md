  Qingqing Cao is a postdoc working with Prof. [Hannaneh Hajishirzi](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~hannaneh/index.html) in the [UW NLP group](https://www.cs.washington.edu/research/nlp) at the University of Washington. He obtained a computer science Ph.D. at Stony Brook University where he worked with Prof. [Aruna Balasubramanian](http://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~arunab/index.html) and Prof. [Niranjan Balasubramanian](http://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~niranjan/index.html). His research interests include efficient NLP, mobile computing, and ML systems. He has focused on building efficient and practical NLP systems for both edge devices and the cloud, such as on-device (visual) question answering (MobiSys 2019, IMWUT 2022), faster Transformer models (ACL 2020), and accurate energy estimation of NLP models (ACL 2021). He was a recipient of the Catacosinos Fellowship at Stony Brook University and a Rising Star in Data Science at the University of Chicago. His website is [awk.ai](https://awk.ai).

  Other research topics include: (1) improving storage/memory/compute efficiency of large language models (LLMs) and retrieval/generation models; (2) building fast/light-weight/on-device language and vision systems; I am generally interested in building efficient models and practical systems for sustainable NLP/AI, so I am happy to collaborate on other possible projects in efficient AI areas.
